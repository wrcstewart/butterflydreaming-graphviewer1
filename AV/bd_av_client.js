/*
 * bd_av_client.js — the client shim for an Ancillary Viewer (AV).
 *
 * WHAT AN AV IS
 * -------------
 * A presentation surface. BD designs the experience and holds the state; an AV
 * renders it on more screen with fewer controls. It is NOT an editor: there is
 * no return channel here, and nothing an AV does reaches the BD database.
 *
 * This file is the reference implementation. A third party building their own
 * AV can copy it unchanged — the only thing that differs is where their page is
 * hosted, and that does not matter, because BD's Socket.IO server accepts any
 * origin (server.js, the `cors` option). Nothing of theirs needs to live in
 * BD's repo or on BD's machine.
 *
 * HOW IT CONNECTS
 * ---------------
 * BD mints a Module Session Token (MST) and opens the viewer with it in the
 * URL:  https://your-host/your-viewer.html?t=<token>
 *
 * The token is SHORT-LIVED and SINGLE-USE. It exists only to bootstrap one
 * socket. It cannot be passed through localStorage or a cookie because those
 * are per-origin, and an AV is deliberately allowed to live anywhere — the URL
 * is the only channel that crosses that boundary.
 *
 * We then connect with it in the Socket.IO handshake:
 *
 *     io(BD_ORIGIN, { auth: { token } })
 *
 * in `auth`, NOT the query string: a query lands in the server's access log,
 * and the token has already been exposed once in the viewer's own URL.
 *
 * THE DATA MODES (see module_data_modes.md)
 * -----------------------------------------
 *   LD  Live Data   this file. Token -> socket -> BD's live state. Needs BD up.
 *   SD  Static Data a published JSON snapshot. Read-only, always available.
 *   UD  URL Data    the payload carried in the link. Self-contained, size-capped.
 *
 * This shim implements LD and reports honestly when it cannot get it. A fuller
 * client would fall back down the ladder; that is left to the viewer, because
 * what a viewer should show when it cannot reach BD depends on what it displays.
